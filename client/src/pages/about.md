## What is [Exauthly](http://github.com/auser/exauthly)

I'm tired of starting new projects and needing to rebuild all the same features over and over for every new project. It's about time that we spend some time building a boilerplate to take care of all these pesky features.

### What are these features?

Said another way, what does this boilerplate give you out of the box?

* Elixir/Phoenix 1.3 application
* Guardian authentication
  * Username/password
  * Social login
* Tested (exauthly was built using test-driven/test-behind development)
* React/Redux/Apollo front-end
* Ultra-fast development speed using [FuseBox](http://fuse-box.org/)
* Protected pages for logged-in users only
* GraphQL out of the box with the fantastic [Absinthe](http://absinthe-graphql.org/)
* Logical grouping of users through organizations
* Fine-grained permissions
* and so much more...

### TODO: Finish this please
